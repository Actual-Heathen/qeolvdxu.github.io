<p><h4>Text Baduk</h4>
<center>
  A C++ library for creating, managing, and playing games of Go/Baduk.
  Go is one of the oldest board games in history, dating back to ancient China.
  It stays relevant to computers today due to is simple rules yet complex strategy
  which makes it one of the only board games that has not had an AI who can beat the
  international champion. I created this library to have an open source way to let anyone
  easily create their own Baduk games to use with their own AI implementations, game variations,
  or even just a UI to play the standard game.
